# LoansAndInterestRates
Write a program that will tell you how many months it will take you to pay off this loan in  particular and any loan in general. Your program also needs to calculate the total amount  of interest paid over the life of any loan. Use a loop to calculate the amount of interest  and  the  size  of  the  debt  after  each  month.  Your  program  must  output  the  monthly  amount of interest paid and remaining debt. Use a variable to count the number of loop  iterations and hence the number of months until the debt is zero. You may want to use  other variables as well. The last payment may be less than $50 if the debt is small, but do  not forget the interest. If you owe $50, then your monthly payment of $50 will not pay  off your debt, although it will come close. One monthâ€™s interest on $50 is only 75 cents.
